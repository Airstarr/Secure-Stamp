# 🔐 Secure Stamp

**Secure Stamp** is an innovative blockchain-based solution designed to **ensure product authenticity** throughout the supply chain. It enables manufacturers, distributors, and consumers to verify the provenance of physical products via secure, immutable, and decentralized records.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Counterfeiting costs the global economy billions each year. Secure Stamp combats this by providing a transparent, tamper-proof system that tracks and verifies each product’s journey — from creation to end-user delivery — using blockchain technology.

---

## 🧩 Key Features

* ✅ **Product Authentication**: Verify if a product is genuine in real time.
* 📦 **Supply Chain Tracking**: Track every stage of the product's journey.
* 🔗 **Blockchain-Powered**: All transactions are recorded on-chain for transparency and security.
* 📱 **QR Code Integration**: Scan a QR code to fetch a product’s authenticity record.
* 🔐 **Tamper-Proof Records**: Immutable data stored on a distributed ledger.

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

* **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (Ethereum-compatible chain or Stacks Clarity, depending on implementation)
* **Blockchain Platform**: Ethereum / Polygon / Stacks
* **Backend**: Node.js / Python (API for product registration and queries)
* **Frontend**: React.js
* **Database**: IPFS / MongoDB (for off-chain metadata)
* **QR Code Generation**: `qrcode` library (Node/Python)
* **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask / Hiro Wallet

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Manufacturer Registers Product**

   * A smart contract mints a unique token (NFT or similar) representing the product.
   * Metadata (batch number, date, factory info) is stored on-chain or via IPFS.
   * A QR code is generated and printed on the product.

2. **Supply Chain Updates**

   * Distributors and retailers can scan and log location/time updates to the blockchain.

3. **Customer Verification**

   * End-users scan the QR code via the app or web interface.
   * They see the full provenance and verify authenticity directly from the blockchain.

## 📄 Smart Contract Overview

* **registerProduct**: Mints a new product NFT/token with metadata.
* **updateLocation**: Adds a location log to the product’s history.
* **verifyProduct**: Fetches product data and displays its provenance.

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Smart contracts (e.g., with Hardhat)
npx hardhat test

# Backend (Jest or Mocha)
npm test

# Frontend
npm test
```
